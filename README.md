# Preface {-}

These are my excerpts and personal notes on the "Discrete Data Analysis with R" textbook by Michael Friendly and David Meyer.

Visualization and Modeling Techniques for Categorical and Count Data
(1st ed.). Chapman and Hall/CRC.

## Motivation {-}

The two main purposes of my notes are 

1. fostering my learning about categorical data analysis by writing excerpts and experimenting with the code and
2. converting base R code to its newer **{tidyverse}** alternative.

R scripts and data files are taken from the [book
website](http://ddar.datavis.ca/). The book is supported directly by the R packages **{[vcd](http://cran.r-project.org/package=vcd)}** and **{[vcdExtra](http://cran.r-project.org/package=vcdExtra)}**, along with numerous other R packages. There is 

- a [list of packages](http://ddar.datavis.ca/pages/using#r-packages) used 
- a [list of the data sets](http://ddar.datavis.ca/pages/using#data-sets-by-package) used in the book, by package and
- a [list of files with R code](http://ddar.datavis.ca/pages/using#r-code) per chapter or as a [zip file](http://ddar.datavis.ca/pages/Rcode/DDAR-Rcode.zip).
