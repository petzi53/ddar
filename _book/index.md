These are my excerpts and personal notes on the "Discrete Data Analysis with R" textbook by Michael Friendly and David Meyer.

# Preface

Friendly, M., & Meyer, D. (2015). Discrete Data Analysis with {R}:
Visualization and Modeling Techniques for Categorical and Count Data
(1st ed.). Chapman and Hall/CRC.

My notes on [@Friendly_Meyer_2015] are part excerpt and part personal notes (comments). Most of the text are quotes
taken directly from the book, which I have not marked especially.
Sometimes I commented or put forward my own thought. In those cases I
have formatted the text as a quotation.

> This is an example of a paragraph marked as a quotation. These type of
> formatted text passages present --- contrary to the usual formatting
> habits --- my own thoughts, whereas excerpts or quotes from the
> textbook is not marked specially.

R scripts and data files are taken from the [book
website](http://ddar.datavis.ca/). The book is supported directly by the R packages **{[vcd](http://cran.r-project.org/package=vcd)}** and **{[vcdExtra](http://cran.r-project.org/package=vcdExtra)}**, along with numerous other R packages. There is 

- a [list of packages](http://ddar.datavis.ca/pages/using#r-packages) used 
- a [list of the data sets](http://ddar.datavis.ca/pages/using#data-sets-by-package) used in the book, by package and
- a [list of files with R code](http://ddar.datavis.ca/pages/using#r-code) per chapter or as a [zip file](http://ddar.datavis.ca/pages/Rcode/DDAR-Rcode.zip).
